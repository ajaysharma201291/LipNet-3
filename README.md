# LipNet

This repository is a re-implementation of LipNet in Tensorflow.
So far the results do not match what is reported in the paper.

To pre-process the images you will need to download:
 * [pre-trained dlib face detector model](http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2)
 * [Grid videos and labels](http://spandh.dcs.shef.ac.uk/gridcorpus/)

 And put them in appropriate directories.
